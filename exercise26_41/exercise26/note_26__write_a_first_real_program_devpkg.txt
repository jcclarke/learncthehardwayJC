excecise 26	- In this program we create a simple program that installs software

				- The program is call devpkg and does the following:
					- devpkg -S
						Sets up a new install on a computer.
					- devpkg -I
						Installs a piece of sofware form a URL.
					- devpkg -L
						Lists all the software that's been installed.
					- devpkg -F
						Fetches some source code for manual building.
					- devpkg -B
						Builds fetched source code and installs it, even if already installed.

				- The program reuses other peoples libraries which are mentioned below:
					- the portability library from "The Apache Portable Runtime(APR)"
						- retrieve and installed from:
							- apr-1.4.6
								https://archive.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-1.4.6.tar.gz
							- apr-util-1.4.1
								https://archive.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-util-1.4.1.tar.gz
						- more info
							- note_apr.txt
							- apr.apache.orp
					- the better String library (bstring) located at sourceforge

						- more info
							- note_other_libs.txt

				- PROJECT LAYOUT
					- The Makefile source files 
						- bstring.o
							comes from		"bstrlib.c"		&		"bstrlib.h"
						- db.o
							comes from		"db.c"			&		"db.h"			contains code for database routines
						- shell.o
							comes from		"shell.c"		&		"shell.h"		some functions that make running shellcommands easier
						- command.o
							comes from		"command.c"		&		"command.h"		has all the commands devpkg	needs to be useful
						- devpkg.c													contains the main function
