This file explains the meanings of functions and variables in the Better String library 

Bstring library functions and variables documentation retrieved from 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/websnarf/bstrlib/master/bstrlib.txt

excecise 26	- functions and varibles found in bstrlib.c and bstrlib.h 

				- bstring
					A bstring is a pointer to a tagbstring.

						typedef struct tabstring *bstring

				- tagbstring
					A character buffer that has the following

						mlen - lower bound for memory allocation
						slen - the exact length of the bstring
						data - a single contiguous buffer of unsigned chars

				- bread
					Read an entire stream into a bstring (struct), verbatim.
						
						extern bstring bread (bNread readPtr, void * parm);

				- bNread
					works like fread but casts void pointer instead of a FILE pointer.
					A function pointer that allows for block devices (eg sockets,
					blocks of memory, procedurally generated strings, etc) other 
					than just file streams (eg. fread) to be read if desired.
					The function protorype is defined below

						typedef size_t (* bNread) (void *buff, size_t elsize, size_t nelem, void *parm);

				- bdestroy
					Deallocate the bstring passed.
					Returns BSTR_ERR if there is an attempt to call bdestroy 
					on any declared struct tabstring or write protected bstring.

						extern int bdestroy (bstring b);

				- bconchar
					Concatenate the character c to the end of the bstring b.
					returns BSTR_OK of BSTR_ERR.
						
						extern int bconchar (bstring b, char C);

				- bfromcstr
					Take a standard C library style '\0' terminated char buffer and
					generate a bstring with the same contents as the char buffer
					Returns NULL if error occurs

						extern bstring bfromcstr (const char * str);

				- blength
					Returns the length of the bstring. Returns 0 if bstring is NULL

						int blength (const_bstring b);

				- binstr
					Search for the bstring s2 in s1 starting at position pos and 
					looking forward (increasing) driection.
					Returns the first location after pos, or BSTR_ERR if not found.

						extern int binstr (const_bstring s1, int pos, const_bstring);

				- bgets
					Read a bsting from a stream.
					As many bytes as is necessary are read from the terminator is
					consumed or no more characters are available from the stream

						extern bstring bgets (bNgetc getcPtr, void * parm, char terminator);

				- bNgetc
					works like fgetc but casts void pointer instead of a FILE pointer.
					A function pointer that allows for block devices (eg sockets,
					blocks of memory, procedurally generated strings, etc) other 
					than just file streams (eg. fread) to be read if desired.
					The function prototype is defined below

						tpydef int (* bNgetc) (void * parm);

				- bdata
					Returns the char * data portion of the bstring b. If b is NULL,
					NULL is returned.

						char * bdata (bstring b);

				- btrimws
					Delete whitespace contiguous from both ends of the bstrings. This
					function will return with BSTR_ERR if b is NULL or of length 0, 
					otherwise BSTR_OK is retruned

						extern int btrimws (bstring b);

				- BSTR_ERR
					An error indicator
				-
