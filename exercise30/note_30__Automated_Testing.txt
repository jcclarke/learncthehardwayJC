This folder did the following excercises

Automated Testing
excecise 30	- In this program we create a small testing "framework" within the skeleton directory

				- minunit.h
					- We build upon this framework to build a custom unit testing framework
						MinUnit -- A minimal unit testing framework for C.
						Has 3 lines of code.
						Found at jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html
					- Using dbg.h, stdio.h, and stdlib.h we create the desired framework.
						A "RUN_TESTS(name)" function is added to run all the tests.
						It includes an "int main" so that the tests can be run automatically.
	
				
				- libex30_tests.c
					- all test functions are structured so no arguments are taken and a char *
					  of NULL is returned on 'success'. The macros in minunit.h will return an
					  error message to the test runner
					- check_function()
						- looks for the function in the library, errors out if its not found.
						- runs the function and compares the return status to the output.
					- all_tests()
						- The test runner function that controls all the other tests.
						- mu_suite_start()
							Test config setup for common stuff before tests are run.
						- mu_run_test()
							Used to run tests on a function.
						- Returns NULL upon 'success'.
					- RUN_TESTS(all_tests)
						- Wrap a main funtion around the runner.
