This folder did the following excercises

Automated Testing
excecise 33	- In this program we explored sorting linked list (This is not advised in a real program)

				- NOTE:
					The structure of a linked list is not designed/optimized for sorting, since they are 
					horrible (very slow) for sorting. The reason for this execise is to provoke thought 
					on how to manipulate the linked list efficiently by trying to slightly difficult to
					implement these sorting algorithms


				- minunit.h
					- We build upon this framework to build a custom unit testing framework
						MinUnit -- A minimal unit testing framework for C.
						Has 3 lines of code.
						Found at jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html
					- Using dbg.h, stdio.h, and stdlib.h we create the desired framework.
						A "RUN_TESTS(name)" function is added to run all the tests.
						It includes an "int main" so that the tests can be run automatically.
	
				
				- libex30_tests.c
					- all test functions are structured so no arguments are taken and a char *
					  of NULL is returned on 'success'. The macros in minunit.h will return an
					  error message to the test runner
					- check_function()
						- looks for the function in the library, errors out if its not found.
						- runs the function and compares the return status to the output.
					- all_tests()
						- The test runner function that controls all the other tests.
						- mu_suite_start()
							Test config setup for common stuff before tests are run.
						- mu_run_test()
							Used to run tests on a function.
						- Returns NULL upon 'success'.
					- RUN_TESTS(all_tests)
						- Wrap a main funtion around the runner.
