This folder did the following excercises

The Stack, Scope, And Globals
excecise 20	- In this program we explore the stack, scope, and globals
				- variable scope
					- a variable with the same name and typecan be defined in the main and a funtion and they are independant of one another
					- it is also true for a varible defined in an if-statement/loop code block and another in a function above.
					- a new variable defined in a function or code block is localized to itself.
				- Globals
					- use extern to to create globals
					- static declarion in a file with functions that access it can also be used as a Global with limitied access
				- new code file functions
					- extern type 
						it says the variable exists but its in another 'external location
					- static (declaring variables at the top of the file)
						the variable is only used in this file
					- static (decalring variables within a function)
						the variable is defined in the file but only accessible in the function
					- const 
						a constant value
				- Things to do to avoid bugs due to scope and memory in your code
					- Don't "shadow" (duplicate variable name in a function and a code block) a variables in different cde blocks
					- Avoid Globals
					- use get and set functions to access globals if you need them
					- When in doubt, put it on the heap
					- Don't use static variables as the are a pain to use with concurent thread
					- Avoid reusing function parameters
