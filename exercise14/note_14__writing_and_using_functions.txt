This folder did the following excercises

Writing And Using Functions
excecise 14	- 
            -  function structure and usage
				- declarations
					<return-type> <function-name> (parameter-list);
				- definitions
					<return-type> <function-name> (parameter-list)
					{
						function-body
					}
			- Use ANSI instead of K&R function declaration
			- K&R is very old and is defined as seen in the following example:
				int foo(a, b)
					int		a;
					char	*p;
				{
					return 0;
				}
