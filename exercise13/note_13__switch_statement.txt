Switch Statement
excecise 13	- 
            - switch statement structure and usage
                 - switch (<test>)	{
					   case compare-1:
					       if-equal-statement-1
					   case compare-1:
					       if-equal-statement-2
					   ...
					   default:
						   default-statement
				   }
            - You should always put a default statement at the end of your sitch statement to catch any missing inputs.
            - You should always put a break within each case of your switch statement to exit it.
			- breaks make the switch statement act like an if statement.
			- cases without a break statement will "feedthrough" and execute  code within subsequent cases until a "break" or "default" at the end of the switch.
			- cases without a break is useful sometimes (eg see ex13.c), make sure to comment that it is intentional and why!
