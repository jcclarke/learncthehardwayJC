This folder did the following excercises

Meet Duff's Device
excecise 23	- In this program we explore a a means of loop unrolling using do while loop nested in a case switch statement
				- This was done to speedup the code execution. 
				- we include a minimum bunch of repetative code lines that are guaranteed to run in the loop so that
					 the loop code line execution is minimized.
				- mordern compilers do loop unrolling automatically so this is no longer useful
				- NEVER DO THIS AGAIN
