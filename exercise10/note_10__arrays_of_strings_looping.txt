This folder did the following excercises

Arrays of strings, Looping
excecise 10	- Using a 2d Array to make and array of strings
			- First instance of reading commandline arguments from argv[] 
			- argv[0] is always the programs name
			- first use of for loops
			- for structure and usage
				- for (<initialize>; <test>, <step>) {}
				- <initialize>	instantiates the variable under test												(the variable can removed and instatiated before the for statement)
				- <test>		is always required to know the exit condition otherwise you get an infinite loop	(exception are using break or goto statements within the loop)
				- <step>		progresses the initialized variable towards meeting the test condition				(this can be left out at done as a statement in the for loop)
				- <initialize> and <step> can include , separators to include multiple conditons
				- boolean algebra (eg &&, ||, etc) must be used within <test> to check multiple conditions
				- see gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html section 4.7 for more info
